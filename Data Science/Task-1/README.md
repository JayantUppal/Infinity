# Task-1


## Description

- Datasets contains the housing price data of major Indian cities
- Load in a jupyter notebook using Pandas 
- Extract as many insights as you can by looking at the data 
- Present the insights using Matplotlib or Seaborn 


### [Task-1](/Data%20Science/Task-1/Task-1.ipynb)

I analyzed insights of every dataset and found almost same pattern in each dataset. So Task-1.ipynb contains detailed analysis of Chennai housing price dataset.
Here are the insights I gathered from Chennai housing price dataset:-

- The area of the house affects the house prices with a strong relation.
- The second feature that affects the house prices with a strong relation, after area, is the number of bedrooms.
- The area and number of bedrooms share a linear relation with the house price, which means that an increase in area or number of bedrooms, increases the value of the latter.
- Features such as maintenance staff, gymnasium, swimming pool, jogging tracks, shopping malls, ATMs, schools, club house, car parking, hospital, security, AC, Wi-Fi, lift, Vaastu complaint, and remaining categorical features are 100% related to each other.
- That is for all features, except for the area, affect the house prices in a similar manner. For instance, the cost of different houses having the same number of gymnasiums and swimming pools is the same. This observation also holds for houses having the same number of lifts and power backup. Also, any given house has the same number of jogging tracks, sports facility and indoor games in it which affects the house prices in a fixed manner. And many more.
- If we analyze the house prices based on the location, we conclude that the most expensive houses are in Medavakkam, Karapakkam, Sholinganallur, Lyappanthangal, Mogappair whereas houses in Arumbakkam, Chetpet, Tambaram East, Mannivakkam, TNHB have lowest prices.
