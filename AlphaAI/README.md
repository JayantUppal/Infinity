## Non-Technical Questions
**1. Who knows you the best?**


I believe my mother knows me inside out. She is someone who knows when I am happy or when I did a mistake, just by the expression on my face. She understands me and guides me well. Be it a piece of career advice or a personal issue, she has never been wrong with her judgments.

**2. Who is your role model and why?**


Sunder Pichai is someone who has never failed to astound me with his charisma. He is rational, innovative, and a strong believer in perfection. He always has a clear vision in his life and is a change-maker in the field of technology. I consider him as my role model and aspire to bring the same ideas and beliefs as his, in my life.

**3. What would your friends say about you?**


My friends would describe me as a dependable and organized person. I am their go-to person for making plans for an outing and executing them too. They think of me as a flexible individual who can adapt to situations easily and they praise how I maintain a healthy balance between my professional and personal life.

**4. What is the thing you’d never say to another person?**


I would never tell someone that he/she is not capable of doing something. I believe we can always learn new things and there is nothing one cannot do if given proper time and guidance. I would rather assist them to take a step forward than questioning their capabilities.

**5. What is your greatest achievement?**


My greatest achievement was overcoming my stage fear during my previous internship. I have always been someone who gets nervous in front of a larger audience. This fear of mine was challenged a few days back when I had to upload a YouTube tutorial on a topic as a task and that helped get rid of my fear of public speaking and gave a boost to my confidence.

**6. What is your greatest failure?**


My greatest failure was not being able to clear my JEE Advanced examination and get into an IIT for my engineering studies.

**7. What did you learn from your greatest failure?**


I considered not getting into an IIT as my greatest failure but I later realized that a college does not define our opportunities. One can learn from anywhere and make a path for himself in any circumstances. I joined UPES and have not regretted a day since then. I have been growing in terms of my intelligence and skills since Day 1 here and have achieved many milestones, despite not being an IITian too.

**8. What would you like to change about yourself?**


I am very hesitant in asking for help. I tend to struggle alone and complete the task given to me on my own, no matter how many difficulties I face. I am trying to change this as there is no shame in asking for a helping hand as long as we are ready to learn.

**9. If something in your house breaks, what is the first thing you do?**


My first instinct is to figure out if I can fix it and how. In case the item cannot be fixed, the next thought is to clean the mess and find a good replacement for it.

**10. What is the greatest obstacle you’re facing right now?**


The greatest obstacle in this 'new normal' where everything is in online mode. Although there no pause on the learning process, I miss meeting my mentors and that 'work environment'. I feel that personal interaction can never be replaced by online learning and hope to get back to the places, physically.

**11. How do you like to “waste” your time?**


I do not particularly "waste" my time but when I do have some spare time, I enjoy keeping fit and doing a bit of exercise or going to the gym. I also spend my leisure time watching a good movie or my favourite YouTube channel, ElectroBoom, learning electronics in a fun way.

**12. What made you want to apply for this role?**


Alpha AI is known for its challenging opportunities and captivating work. It is a company that helps one gain precious insights into the industry and technology, and being a student who is just about to start his career, I believe this opportunity will provide me with everything to help me upskill myself and give a great push to my job sphere.

**13. How open are you to the idea of doing things outside your job description?**


I am always eager for new opportunities to challenge and upskill myself. So, if there is a task that interests me and requires me to learn new things or explore a new domain, I am ready to go that extra mile and work to the best of my abilities.

**14. Describe a time when you recognized that you were unable to meet multiple deadlines. What did you do about it?**


This happens a lot during our college routine. I do have multiple deadlines for the same day now and then and sometimes during the time of examination too. I manage it by doing tasks that might take less time first, and then giving my time to the elaborate ones. I also use proper calendars and timetables to make sure I do not miss out on any deadline or task.

**15. Give an example of how you work in a situation where you must prioritize and multitask without supervision.**


During my minor project, I was the team leader and had to manage multiple things like project reports, submissions, implementation, and presentations. Along with this, I also had to complete the regular college assignments, tests, and tasks given during my internship. I completed the task with shorter deadlines first, like the college assignments, and simultaneously kept working with my team on the minor project. I had to pull off some all-nighters too but in the end, was able to deliver quality work in time.

**16. Tell me about a day when everything went wrong. How did you handle it?**


I participated in a hackathon last month in a team of four. We had divided the entire work according to our area of interest. In the mid-way of the project implementation, two of my teammates have to back out during a medical emergency, and neither I nor the other teammate was acquainted with the task assigned to them. So we had to work extra and learn that technology within a limited time and complete the hackathon task.
